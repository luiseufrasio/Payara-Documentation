|=======================================================================
|ID |link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss[CVSS Score] |Status |Summary |Release |Observations

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45687[CVE-2024-45687] | 2.4 | FIXED | Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Request/Response Splitting') vulnerability in Payara Platform Payara Server (Grizzly, REST Management Interface modules), Payara Platform Payara Micro (Grizzly modules) allows Manipulating State, Identity Spoofing. | 5.71.0, 4.1.2.191.52 | HTTP Server incorrectly accepting disallowed characters within header values

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-8215[CVE-2024-8215] | 8.7 | FIXED | Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Payara Platform Payara Server (Admin Console modules) allows Remote Code Inclusion. | 5.68.0, 4.1.2.191.51 | Payload Injection Attack via Management REST interface

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-7312[CVE-2024-7312] | 7.0 | FIXED | REST Interface Link Redirection via Host parameter | 5.67.0, 4.1.2.191.50 | Only affects the Server admin REST interface.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29425[CVE-2021-29425] | 4.8 | FIXED | In Apache Commons IO before 2.7, When invoking the method FileNameUtils.normalize with an improper input string, like "//../foo", or "\\..\foo", the result would be the same value, thus possibly providing access to files in the parent directory, but not further above (thus "limited" path traversal), if the calling code would use the result to construct a path value. | 4.1.2.191.49 | Fixed by upgrading Apache Commons IO.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-52428[CVE-2023-52428] | - | FIXED | In Connect2id Nimbus JOSE+JWT before 9.37.2, an attacker can cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a large JWE p2c header value (aka iteration count) for the PasswordBasedDecrypter (PBKDF2) component | 5.64.0 | Fixed by upgrading Nimbus Jose JWT bundled in Payara Server, and the version used to compile the Payara security connectors.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4043[CVE-2023-4043] | 7.5 | FIXED | In Eclipse Parsson before versions 1.1.4 and 1.0.5, Parsing JSON from untrusted sources can lead malicious actors to exploit the fact that the built-in support for parsing numbers with large scale in Java has a number of edge cases where the input text of a number can lead to much larger processing time than one would expect. To mitigate the risk, parsson put in place a size limit for the numbers as well as their scale. | 5.62.0, 4.1.2.191.48 | Fixed by backporting Parsson fixes to the previously unnamed JSONP impl used by Payara 5 & 4

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36374[CVE-2021-36374] | 5.5 | FIXED | A specially crafted ZIP archive can cause an out of memory error | 5.58.0, 4.1.2.191.47 | Fixed by Apache Ant upgrade

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36373[CVE-2021-36373] | 5.5 | FIXED | A specially crafted TAR archive can cause an out of memory error | 5.58.0, 4.1.2.191.47 | Fixed by Apache Ant upgrade

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1370[CVE-2023-1370] | 7.5 | FIXED | [Json-smart](https://netplex.github.io/json-smart/) is a performance focused, JSON processor lib. When reaching a ‘[‘ or ‘{‘ character in the JSON input, the code parses an array or an object respectively. It was discovered that the code does not have any limit to the nesting of such arrays or objects. Since the parsing of nested arrays and objects is done recursively, nesting too many of them can cause a stack exhaustion (stack overflow) and crash the software. | 5.56.0 | Fixed by upgrading shaded json-smart version on Ecosystem Security submodule.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12617[CVE-2017-12617] | 8.1 | FIXED | When running Apache Tomcat versions 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0, 8.5.0 to 8.5.22, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.46 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.81 with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default servlet to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server. | 5.55.0, 4.1.2.191.45 | Fixed by porting solution from Tomcat.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-1370[CVE-2023-1370] | 7.5 | FIXED | Json-smart is a library used by Payara Server for processing JSON in our implementations of MicroProfile. It was discovered that Json-smart does not limit the nesting of arrays or objects, the parsing of which is done recursively, and could lead to stack exhaustion and crash the software.  | 5.51.0 | Fixed by updating Json-smart to 2.4.10.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0265[CVE-2022-0265] | 9.8 | FIXED | Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in GitHub repository hazelcast/hazelcast in 5.1-BETA-1.  || This can only be triggered if explicitly using hazelcast to parse XML data.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28462[CVE-2023-28462] | 9.8 | N/A |JNDI Exploit using `context.rebind` method when running Payara Server on an older JDK 8 Update. The JNDI exploit can be triggered via access to insecure ORB listeners exposed by a Payara Server installation.  | | This issue only affects Payara Server environments that run on Java 1.8 updates equal or lower than `1.8u181`.

NOTE: If running on an older Java 1.8 update, to mitigate this vulnerability it is recommended for all public-facing ORB listeners to be secured (via SSL/TLS security) or disabled.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471[CVE-2022-1471] | 9.8 | FIXED | SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution | 5.51.0 | SnakeYaml constructors are not used by any features or facilities, so this vulnerability doesn't affect Payara Platform Enterprise. Fixed by updating SnakeYaml to 2.0.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2068[CVE-2022-2068] | 9.8 | FIXED | In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. | 5.47.0 | Fixed by removing OpenSSL from Payara Docker Images

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1292[CVE-2022-1292] | 9.8 | FIXED | The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. | 5.47.0 | Fixed by removing OpenSSL from Payara Docker Images

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42920[CVE-2022-42920] | 9.8 | FIXED | Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. | 5.46.0 | Fixed by upgrading Apache BCEL to 6.6.1

|https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-45129[CVE-2022-45129] | 7.5 | FIXED | A vulnerability exploit opens up to attackers a way to explore the contents of the WEB-INF and META-INF folders if an application is deployed to the root context. | 5.45.0 | Internal fix on Servlet engine

The fix in the Payara Platform mitigates the Spring vulnerability by blocking the Payara classloader from giving access to Payara Platform internals.

|https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42392[CVE-2021-42392] | N/A | N/A | Unauthenticated RCE in H2 Database Console |  | Doesn't affect Payara Platform. The Payara Platform doesn't launch the H2 Database Console and doesn't make it available in any way.

| https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40690/[CVE-2021-40690] | 7.5 | FIXED | The "secureValidation" property is not passed correctly when creating a KeyInfo from a KeyInfoReference element, allowing abuse of an XPath Transform to extract any local .xml files in a RetrievalMethod element. | 5.34.0 | Fixed by upgrading Apache Santuario to 2.2.3
