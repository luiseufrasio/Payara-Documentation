= Building Payara IntelliJ Tools

The process of building and testing the IntelliJ IDEA IDE Plugin is the same for both the Ultimate and Community editions.
The Payara IntelliJ Tools source code is available in the https://github.com/payara/ecosystem-intellij-plugin[ecosystem-intellij-plugin repository].

Before building the Payara IntelliJ Tools, you will need to configure your local environment. Subsequent builds will not require these steps.

Clone the repository::
You must first clone the plugin repository:

```
    git clone https://github.com/payara/ecosystem-intellij-plugin.git
```

JDK 11::
JDK 11 is required to build and test the IntelliJ IDEA plugin.

Install Gradle::
Gradle is the build tool for the Payara IntelliJ Tools. You can either download and configure Gradle locally or use the Gradle wrapper in the source code.

[[testing-intellij-plugin]]
== Test Payara Tools

Instead of manually installing the plugin each time, you can run a test instance of IntelliJ IDEA with the plugin pre-installed using the following:

*If you installed Gradle*

. `gradle runIde`

*If you are using the Gradle wrapper*

. `./gradlew runIde`

This will launch a sandboxed IntelliJ IDEA environment with the plugin enabled for testing purposes.
