:ordinal: 1

This chapter provides instructions for performing general administration tasks in the Payara Server environment by using the `asadmin` command-line utility.

[[using-the-asadmin-utility]]
== Using the `asadmin` Utility

Use the `asadmin` utility to perform administrative tasks for Payara Server from the command line or from a script. You can use this utility instead of the Administration Console interface.

[[path-to-the-asadmin-utility]]
=== Path to the `asadmin` Utility

The `asadmin` utility is located in the `as-install/bin` directory. To run the `asadmin` utility without specifying the path, ensure that this directory is in your path.

[[asadmin-utility-syntax]]
=== `asadmin` Utility Syntax

The syntax for running the `asadmin` utility is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
asadmin [asadmin-util-options] [subcommand [subcommand-options] [operands]]
----

The replaceable items in this syntax are described in the subsections that follow.

[[subcommands-of-the-asadmin-utility]]
==== *Subcommands of the `asadmin` Utility*

The subcommand identifies the operation or task that you are performing. Subcommands are case-sensitive. Each subcommand is either a local subcommand or a remote subcommand.

* A local subcommand can be run without a running domain administration server (DAS). However, to run the subcommand and have access to the installation directory and the domain directory, the user must be logged in to the machine that hosts the domain.
* A remote subcommand is always run by connecting to a DAS and running the subcommand there. A running DAS is required.

[[asadmin-utility-options-and-subcommand-options]]
==== *`asadmin` Utility Options and Subcommand Options*

Options control the behavior of the `asadmin` utility and its subcommands. Options are case-sensitive.

The `asadmin` utility has the following types of options:

*`asadmin` utility options*:: These options control the behavior of the `asadmin` utility, not the subcommand.
+
The `asadmin` utility options may precede or follow the subcommand, but `asadmin` utility options after the subcommand are deprecated.
+
All `asadmin` utility options must either precede or follow the subcommand. If `asadmin` utility options are specified both before and after the subcommand, an error occurs.

*Subcommand Options*:: These options control the behavior of the subcommand, not the `asadmin` utility. Subcommand options must follow the subcommand. +

A subcommand option may have the same name as an `asadmin` utility option, but the effects of the two options are different.

Options have a long form and a short form.

* The short form of an option has a single dash (`-`) followed by a single character.
* The long form of an option has two dashes (`--`) followed by an option word.

For example, the short form and the long form of the option for specifying terse output are as follows:

* Short form: `-t`
* Long form: `--terse`

TIP: Most options require argument values, except `Boolean` options, which toggle to enable or disable a feature.

[[operands-of-asadmin-utility-subcommands]]
==== *Operands of `asadmin` Utility Subcommands*

Operands specify the items on which the subcommand is to act. Operands must follow the argument values of subcommand options, and are set off by a space, a tab, or double dashes (`--`). The `asadmin` utility treats anything that follows the subcommand options and their values as an operand.

[[to-run-an-asadmin-utility-subcommand-in-single-mode]]
=== To Run an `asadmin` Utility Subcommand in Single Mode

In single mode, you must type a separate `asadmin` command for each subcommand that you want to use. After the subcommand has run, you are returned to the operating system's command shell. Any `asadmin` utility options must be specified in each separate `asadmin` command that you run.

If you require the same `asadmin` utility options for multiple subcommands, use the `asadmin` utility in multimode.
For more information, see xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/General Runtime Administration.adoc#to-start-a-multimode-session[To Start a Multimode Session].

. In the operating system's command shell, run the `asadmin` utility, specifying the subcommand.
. If necessary, also specify any required `asadmin` utility options, subcommand options, and operands.

==== Example 2-1 Running an asadmin Utility Subcommand in Single Mode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin list-applications
hello <web>
Command list-applications executed successfully.
----

This example runs the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-applications.adoc[`list-applications`] subcommand in single mode.
In this example, the default values for all options are used.

The example shows that the application `hello` is deployed on the local host.

==== Example 2-2 Specifying an asadmin Utility Option With a Subcommand in Single Mode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --host srvr1.example.com list-applications
basic-ezcomp <web>
scrumtoys <web>
ejb31-war <ejb, web>
automatic-timer-ejb <ejb>
Command list-applications executed successfully.
----

This example specifies the `--host` `asadmin` utility option with the `list-applications` subcommand in single mode.
In this example, the DAS is running on the host `srvr1.example.com`.

The example shows that the applications `basic-ezcomp`, `scrumtoys`, `ejb31-war`, and `automatic-timer-ejb` are deployed on the host `srvr1.example.com`.

==== Example 2-3 Specifying an `asadmin` Utility Option and a Subcommand Option in Single Mode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --host srvr1.example.com list-applications --type web
basic-ezcomp <web>
scrumtoys <web>
ejb31-war <ejb, web>
Command list-applications executed successfully.
----

This example specifies the `--host` `asadmin` utility option and the `--type` subcommand option with the `list-applications` subcommand in single mode.
In this example, the DAS is running on the host `srvr1.example.com` and applications of type `web` are to be listed.

[[to-display-help-information-for-the-asadmin-utility-or-a-subcommand]]
=== To Display Help Information for the `asadmin` Utility or a Subcommand

Payara Server provides help information about the syntax, purpose, and options of the `asadmin` utility and its subcommands.

This help information is also available in the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc[Payara Server Command Reference Manual].

. If you are displaying help information for a remote subcommand, ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.

. Specify the subcommand of interest as the operand of the `help` subcommand. If you run the `help` subcommand without an operand, help information for the `asadmin` utility is displayed.

==== Example 2-4 Displaying Help Information for the `asadmin` Utility

[source,shell]
----
asadmin help
----

This example displays the help information for the `asadmin` utility.

==== Example 2-5 Displaying Help Information for an `asadmin` Utility Subcommand

[source,shell]
----
asadmin help create-jdbc-resource
----

This example displays the help information for the `create-jdbc-resource` subcommand.

To display the available subcommands, use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-commands.adoc[`list-commands`] subcommand. Local subcommands are displayed before remote subcommands. If the server is not running, only local subcommands are displayed.

[[to-start-a-multimode-session]]
=== To Start a Multimode Session

The `asadmin` utility can be used in multiple command mode, or multimode. In multimode, you run the `asadmin` utility once to start a multimode session.During the session, the `asadmin` utility continues to accept subcommands until you end the session and return to the operating system's command shell.

Any `asadmin` utility options that you set for your multimode session are used for all subsequent subcommands in the session.

NOTE: Starting a multimode session does not require a running DAS.

. Do one of the following:
+
* Run the `asadmin` utility without a subcommand.
* Use the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/multimode.adoc[`multimode`] subcommand.

. If necessary, also specify any `asadmin` utility options that will apply throughout the multimode session.
. In a multimode session, the `asadmin>` prompt is displayed on the command line. You can now type `asadmin` subcommands at this prompt to administer Payara Server.

==== Example 2-6 Starting a Multimode Session With `asadmin` Utility Options

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --user admin1 --passwordfile pwd.txt multimode
----
This example starts a multimode session in which the `asadmin` utility options `--user` and `--passwordfile` are set for the session.

==== Example 2-7 Starting a Multimode Session by Using the `multimode` Subcommand

[source,shell]
----
asadmin multimode
----
This example uses the `multimode` subcommand to start a multimode session in which the default `asadmin` utility options are used.


The `asadmin>` prompt is displayed on the command line.

==== Example 2-8 Running a Subcommand in a Multimode Session

[source,shell]
----
asadmin
Use "exit" to exit and "help" for online help.

asadmin> list-domains
Name: domain1 Status: Running
Command list-domains executed successfully.
asadmin>
----
This example starts a multimode session and runs the `list-domains` subcommand in the session.

*Starting a Multimode Session From Within an Existing Multimode Session*

You can start a multimode session from within an existing session by
running the `multimode` subcommand from within the existing session.
After you end the second multimode session, you return to your original
multimode session.

[[to-end-a-multimode-session]]
=== To End a Multimode Session

At the `asadmin>` prompt, type one of the following commands or key combinations:

* `exit`
* `quit`
* UNIX and Linux systems: `Ctrl-D`
* Windows systems: `Ctrl-Z`

CAUTION: Do not type `Ctrl-C` to end a multimode session. If a domain or Payara Server instance is started from the multimode session, typing `Ctrl-C` kills the domain or instance process.

You are returned to the operating system's command shell and the `asadmin>` prompt is no longer displayed. If the `asadmin>` prompt is still displayed, you might have opened a multimode session within a multimode session. In this situation, repeat this procedure to end the remaining multimode session.

[[enable-asadmin-cli-multimode-event-designators]]
=== To enable Multimode Session Event Designators

This feature allows the use of **Bash Event Designators** when using Payara Server's Asadmin CLI in multimode.

An Event Designator is a reference to a command line entry in the history list, which makes it easy for users to refer and re-use previous asadmin subcommands entries.

IMPORTANT: This feature is disabled by default in Payara Server and has to be enabled first before being used.

WARNING: If this feature is enabled, all occurrences of the `\` character will be escaped and thus, removed before running the corresponding command. You'll have to escape these characters and turn them into `\\` for any commands to be properly parsed.

[[enabling-jline-event]]
==== Enabling JLine Event Expansion

To enable support for JLine event designators just set the `AS_ADMIN_DISABLE_EVENT_EXPANSION` environment variable to `false`. Follow these steps depending on your operating system:

[[in-linux]]
===== Linux and *Nix variants
. Open the Terminal
. Type the following command
+
[source, shell]
----
export AS_ADMIN_DISABLE_EVENT_EXPANSION=false
----
+
. Check that the variable has been correctly set:
+
[source, shell]
----
echo $AS_ADMIN_DISABLE_EVENT_EXPANSION
----

[[in-windows]]
===== Windows
. Open Command Prompt as an Administrator
. Type the following commands
+
[source, shell]
----
setx AS_ADMIN_DISABLE_EVENT_EXPANSION "false" /m
set AS_ADMIN_DISABLE_EVENT_EXPANSION=false
----
+
. Check that the variable has been correctly set:
+
----
echo %AS_ADMIN_DISABLE_EVENT_EXPANSION%
----

[[to-run-a-set-of-asadmin-subcommands-from-a-file]]
=== To Run a Set of `asadmin` Subcommands From a File

Running a set of `asadmin` subcommands from a file enables you to automate repetitive tasks.

. Create a plain text file that contains the sequence of subcommands that you want to run.
. Run the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/multimode.adoc[`multimode`] subcommand, specifying the file that you created.
+
If necessary, also specify any `asadmin` utility options that are required to enable subcommands in the file to run.

==== Example 2-9 Running a Set of `asadmin` Subcommands From a File.

[source,shell]
----
create-domain --portbase 9000 customdomain
start-domain customdomain
list-commands
stop-domain customdomain
delete-domain customdomain
----
This example contains the following:

* A listing of a file that is named `commands_file.txt`, which contains a sequence of `asadmin` subcommands.
* The command to run the subcommands in the file `commands_file.txt`

The `commands_file.txt` file contains the `asadmin` utility subcommands to perform the following sequence of operations:

. Creating the domain `customdomain`
. Starting the domain `customdomain`
. Listing all available subcommands
. Stopping the domain `customdomain`
. Deleting the domain `customdomain`

This example runs the sequence of subcommands in the `commands_file.txt` file. Because the `--portbase` option is specified for the `create-domain` subcommand in the file, the `--port` `asadmin` utility option must also be set.

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --port 9048 multimode --file commands_file.txt
----

For more information about the subcommands in the preceding example, see the following help pages:

* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-domain.adoc[`create-domain`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/delete-domain.adoc[`delete-domain`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-commands.adoc[`list-commands`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/multimode.adoc[`multimode`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/start-domain.adoc[`start-domain`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/stop-domain.adoc[`stop-domain`]

//TODO - Review if these features are working properly in Payara Server: attach, detach, managed jobs
//Also, update documentation on related commands

[[to-run-asadmin-subcommands-in---detach-mode]]
=== To Run `asadmin` Subcommands in `--detach` Mode

You can use the `--detach` option of the `asadmin` utility to detach `asadmin` subcommands and run them in the background in detach mode. The `asadmin` `--detach` option is useful for long-running subcommands and enables you to run several independent subcommands from one console or script.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote commands require a running server.
. Detach and run the subcommand by using the `asadmin` `--detach` option.

==== Example 2-10 Using the `--detach` Option in Single Mode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin --detach create-cluster Cluster1
Job ID: 1
Command create-cluster started successfully.
----
This example uses the `asadmin` `--detach` option in single mode to run the `create-cluster` subcommand.

==== Example 2-11 Using the `--detach` Option in Multimode

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> create-cluster Cluster1 --detach
Job ID: 1
Command create-cluster started successfully.
----
This example uses the `asadmin` `--detach` option in multimode to run the `create-cluster` subcommand.

Job IDs are assigned to subcommands that are started using the `asadmin` `--detach` option or that contain progress information.
You can use the `list-jobs` subcommand to list jobs and their job IDs, the `attach` subcommand to reattach to a job and view its status, and the `configure-managed-jobs` subcommand to configure how long information about jobs is kept.

==== Example 2-12 Listing Jobs

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> list-jobs
JOB ID     COMMAND           STATE       EXIT CODE TIME OF COMPLETION
1          create-instance    COMPLETED   SUCCESS   2023-02-15 16:16:16 PST
2          deploy            COMPLETED   FAILURE   2023-02-15 18:26:30 PST
Command list-jobs executed successfully
----
This example runs the `list-jobs` subcommand in multimode to list jobs and job information.

==== Example 2-13 Attaching to a Subcommand and Checking Its Status

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> attach 1
Command create-cluster executed with status SUCCESS.
Command attach executed successfully.
----
This example runs the `attach` subcommand in multimode to attach to the `create-cluster` subcommand with a job ID of `1`. If a subcommand is still in progress, the output displays the current status, such as percentage complete.

==== Example 2-14 Configuring Managed Jobs

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> configure-managed-jobs --job-retention-period=36h
Command configure-managed-jobs executed successfully.
----

This example runs the `configure-managed-jobs` subcommand in multimode to set the job retention period to 36 hours. Time periods can be specified in `Hh|Mm|Ss` format for hours, minutes, or seconds.

For the full syntax and options of the subcommands in the preceding examples, see the following help pages:

* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/attach.adoc[`attach`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/configure-managed-jobs.adoc[`configure-managed-jobs`]
* xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-jobs.adoc[`list-jobs`]

[[administering-system-properties]]
== Administering System Properties

Shared server instances will often need to override attributes defined in their referenced configuration. Any configuration attribute can be overridden through a system property of the corresponding name.

[[to-create-system-properties]]
=== To Create System Properties

Use the `create-system-properties` subcommand in remote mode to create or update one or more system properties of the domain or configuration. Any configuration attribute can be overwritten through a system property of the corresponding name.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. Create system properties by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-system-properties.adoc[`create-system-properties`] subcommand.

==== Example 2-15 Creating a System Property

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> create-system-properties http-listener-port=1088
Command create-system-properties executed successfully.
----
This example creates a system property associated with `http-listener-port=1088` on `localhost`.

[[to-list-system-properties]]
=== To List System Properties

Use the `list-system-properties` subcommand in remote mode to list the system properties that apply to a domain, cluster, or server instance or configuration.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. List system properties by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-system-properties.adoc[`list-system-properties`] subcommand.

The existing system properties are displayed, including predefined properties such as `HTTP_LISTENER_PORT` and `HTTP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT`.

==== Example 2-16 Listing System Properties

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> list-system-properties
http-listener-port=1088
Command list-system-properties executed successfully.
----
This example lists the system properties on host `localhost`.

[[to-delete-a-system-property]]
=== To Delete a System Property

Use the `delete-system-property` subcommand in remote mode to delete system properties.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. List the existing system properties by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-system-properties.adoc[`list-system-properties`] subcommand.
. Delete the system property by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/delete-system-property.adoc[`delete-system-property`] subcommand.
. If necessary, notify users that the system property has been deleted.

==== Example 2-17 Deleting a System Property

[source, shell]
----
asadmin> delete-system-property http-listener-port
Command delete-system-property executed successfully.
----
This example deletes a system property named `http-listener-port` from `localhost`.

[[list-of-system-properties]]
=== System Properties Inventory

The following properties are used exclusively by Payara Server to configure specific settings across multiple features:

`fish.payara.clientHttpsProtocol`::
Sets the TLS version to be used by the asadmin client.
+
This is separate from the TLS version set for HTTPS communication on a listener.
+
Valid values are:

* `TLSv1.2`,
* `TLSv1.3`
* `TLSv1.3` (default)

`fish.payara.classloading.delegate`::
When set to `false`, libraries from applications, and `domain-dir/lib` will override the library in the `as-install/glassfish/modules` directory
+
Defaults to `true`.

`fish.payara.admin.command.jline.log.disable`::
When set to `true`, JLine logging entries for invalid key bindings and other unwanted errors will be prevented
+
NOTE: This is a property used exclusively by the Asadmin CLI
+
Defaults to `false`

`fish.payara.deployment.transform.namespace`::
When set to `true`, namespace transformation (`javax.\*` to `jakarta.\*` package refactoring) is always performed.
+
If the value is `undefined` then auto transformation is performed on the absence of `jakarta.\*` classes in the deployment archive otherwise transformation task is disabled.
+
Defaults to `null` (undefined)

`fish.payara.permittedFormBasedAuthHttpMethods` ::
A comma separated list of HTTP methods that are permitted to use for FORM based authentication (`j_security_check`).
+
If not set all HTTP methods are permitted.
+
Valid values are:

* `GET`
* `HEAD`
* `POST`
* `PUT`
* `DELETE`
* `CONNECT`
* `OPTIONS`
* `TRACE`
* `PATCH`
+
Defaults to `null` (undefined)

`fish.payara.shutdowngrace`::
After server shutdown is initiated the server waits this period of time (in seconds) to finish ongoing requests before terminating.
+
New requests are still accepted during this grace period. Accepts values between `0` - `Integer.MAX` and defaults to `0`.

`fish.payara.SO_KEEPALIVE`::
Enables keep alive (`SO_KEEPALIVE`) on the sockets created by an IIOP listener. Can be set as a global system property, or as a property on a specific listener (with the latter taking precedence over the global setting if both are set).
+
NOTE: Replaces deprecated property `fish.payara.SOKeepAlive`.
+
Defaults to `false`

`org.glassfish.grizzly.DEFAULT_MEMORY_MANAGER`::
If option (defined as JVM Option with `-D` or as System Property value) `org.glassfish.grizzly.DEFAULT_MEMORY_MANAGER` is not present in the server/instance configuration, the server will override the Grizzly default and use the `HeapMemoryManager` class.
+
To override this behaviour (so to use a different memory manager), you must specify this JVM option in the server/instance config with your desired setting.
+
Valid values are:

* `org.glassfish.grizzly.memory.HeapMemoryManager` (default)
* `org.glassfish.grizzly.memory.PooledMemoryManager`
* `org.glassfish.grizzly.memory.ByteBufferManager`

`deployment.resource.validation`::
This option (defined as JVM Option with `-D` or as System Property value) defines if the resources are validated during deployment of the application.
+
When active, the default value, all JNDI references are verified but those references can be provided by the application itself and thus not yet available at deployment time (for example the `java:module/env/` based ones).
+
By setting this option to `false`, validation is not performed and deployment will succeed.
+
However, issues will occur at runtime of the application in case of errors in the references.
+
Defaults to `true`

`fish.payara.faces.integration.allowFacesCdiInitialisation`::
This option defines if scanning for Jakarta Faces content during application deployment is enabled, forcing an attempt to initialise CDI and Weld even if bean discovery is set to "none" if Faces content is detected.
+
A similar property can be set as a property `deploy` command. See xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/deploy.adoc#deploy[deploy] for details.
+
The `deploy` command property has precedence over the value defined by this property.
+
Default is `false`.

`fish.payara.javax.servlet.jsp.disable-static-field-references`::
This option brings back the behaviour of evaluating EL in JSP pages from previous iterations.
+
When enabled, a static field reference won't be evaluated.
+
Defaults to `false`

`fish.payara.node.ssh.timeout`::
This option sets the SSH timeout in milliseconds for running commands on SSH nodes.
+
This is a separate timeout to the Asadmin CLI communication or any command specific timeout, this is specifically for the SSH connection used for running certain commands that operate on the remote node itself (e.g. `setup-ssh` and `start-instance`).
+
If set to an invalid value a warning will be logged and the default will be used.
+
Accepts values from `1` - `Integer.MAX`. Defaults to `120000ms`

`fish.payara.tenantcontrol.blocking.disable`::
This option determines if a server instance should skip its standard checks for if it is available for a Hazelcast `Tenantable` object.
+
Defaults to `true`.

//Conditional block, only rendered for the Community Edition
ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "community"]
`fish.payara.autoscale.maxscale`::
This option sets the default maximum boundary for the number of instances to scale up or down by when using auto-scale groups.
+
Accepts values from `1` - `Integer.MAX`. Defaults to `100` instances.
endif::[]

//Conditional block, only rendered for the Enterprise Edition
ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "enterprise"]
`fish.payara.upgrade.repo.url`::
This option defines the Maven repository URL used by the `upgrade-server` command.
+
Accepts a URL pointing to the Payara Enterprise Nexus repository to download from (expected to point to the `fish/payara/distributions` directory of the repository).
+
Defaults to `https://nexus.payara.fish/repository/payara-enterprise-downloadable-artifacts/fish/payara/distributions/`
endif::[]

`hazelcast.cp-subsystem.auto-promote`::
When the Payara Server's Data Grid/Hazelcast CP subsystem is enabled (more than `0` members are configured), this option will enable or disable an auto-promote behaviour that will allow other server instances to join the Hazelcast CP subsystem when detected by the DAS.
+
IMPORTANT: The CP subsystem is automatically enabled on the Data Grid/Hazelcast when the `hazelcast.cp-subsystem.cp-member-count` system property is set an integer greater than zero.
+
Defaults to `true`

`hazelcast.auto-partition-group`::
Enables/disables Hazelcast group auto-partitioning behaviour in Payara Server's Data Grid.
+
When auto-partitioning is turned on, instances that join the Data Grid will not follow the default partition group configuration strategy and instead will form individual partition groups. Read more about how partition groups work in the official link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.3/clusters/partition-group-configuration[Hazelcast Platform documentation].
+
This option is intended to make member partitioning work consistently for highly dynamic environments (like Kubernetes).
+
CAUTION: Use this option with extreme care

//TODO - Not sure what this feature is for and how it works or it is properly supported.

[[using-configuration-modularity]]
== Using Configuration Modularity

With configuration modularity in Payara Server, new modules can be added to Payara Server distributions without modifying the global `domain.xml` configuration file. Default configuration data for modules is stored in the modules themselves, rather than in `domain.xml`, and loaded when needed.

Module configuration elements are stored in `domain.xml` only when the default configuration included in the module is changed or when module configuration elements are added to `domain.xml` using the `create-module-config` subcommand. The `delete-module-config` subcommand removes module configuration elements from `domain.xml`, and the `get-active-module-config` subcommand displays the current active configuration of a module.

[[to-add-the-default-configuration-of-a-module-to-domain.xml]]
=== To Add the Default Configuration of a Module to `domain.xml`

Use the `create-module-config` subcommand to add the default configuration of a module to `domain.xml`.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. Add the default configuration of a module to `domain.xml` by using xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-jdbc-resource.adoc[`create-module-config`] subcommand.

==== Example 2-18 Adding Module Configuration to `domain.xml`

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> create-module-config web-container
Command create-module-config executed successfully.
----
This example adds the default configuration of the web container module to `domain1` in `server-config` (the default configuration).
Use the `--dryrun` option to preview the configuration before it is added.

[[to-remove-the-configuration-of-a-module-from-domain.xml]]
=== To Remove the Configuration of a Module From `domain.xml`

Use the `delete-module-config` subcommand to remove the configuration of a module from `domain.xml` and cause the module to
use the default configuration included in the module.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. Remove the configuration of a module from `domain.xml` by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-jdbc-resource.adoc[`delete-module-config`] subcommand.

==== Example 2-19 Removing Module Configuration From `domain.xml`

[source,shell]
----
asadmin> delete-module-config web-container
Command delete-module-config executed successfully.
----
This example deletes the configuration of the web container module from `domain1` in `server-config` (the default configuration).

[[to-display-the-current-active-configuration-of-a-module]]
=== To Display the Current Active Configuration of a Module

== Administering Resources

This section contains instructions for integrating resources into the Payara Server environment.Information about administering specific resources, such as JDBC, is contained in other chapters.

[[to-add-resources-from-an-xml-file]]
=== To Add Resources From an XML File

Use the `add-resources` subcommand in remote mode to create the resources named in the specified XML file.
The following resources are supported: JDBC connection pool and resource, JMS, JNDI, and JavaMail resources, custom resource, connector resource and work security map, admin object, and resource adapter configuration.

The XML file must reside in the `domain-dir/config` directory. If you specify a relative path or simply provide the name of the XML file, this subcommand will prepend `domain-dir/config` to this operand.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. Add resources from an XML file by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/add-resources.adoc[`add-resources`] subcommand. Information about properties for the subcommand is included in this help page.
. Restart Payara Server. See xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/General Administration/Administering Domains.adoc#to-restart-a-domain[To Restart a Domain].

[[to-list-timers]]
=== To List Timers

The timer service is a persistent and transactional notification service that is provided by the enterprise bean container and is used to schedule notifications or events used by enterprise beans. All enterprise beans except stateful session beans can receive notifications from the timer service.

Persistent timers set by the
service are not destroyed when the server is shut down or restarted.

Use the `list-timers` subcommand in remote mode to list the persistent timers owned by a specific server instance. You can use this information to decide whether to do a timer migration, or to verify that a migration has been completed successfully.

. Ensure that the server is running. Remote subcommands require a running server.
. List timers by using the xref:ROOT:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/list-timers.adoc[`list-timers`] subcommand.
