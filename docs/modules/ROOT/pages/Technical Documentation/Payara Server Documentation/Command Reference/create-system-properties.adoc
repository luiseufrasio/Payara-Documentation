[[description]]
== Description

The `create-system-properties` subcommand adds or updates system properties that can be referenced elsewhere on the server.

Payara Server provides hooks where tokens (system properties) can be specified. Because Payara Server does not have multiple server
elements, you can specify a particular token at any level. When a domain supports multiple servers, the override potential can be exploited. When
a domain is started or restarted, all `<system-property>` elements are resolved and available to the Java Virtual Machine by using the
`System.setProperty()` call on each of them (with its name and value derived from the corresponding attributes of the element). This is
analogous to sending the elements as `-D` parameters on the Java command line.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

[[operands]]
== Operands

target::
  The valid targets for this subcommand are instance, cluster,   configuration, domain, and server. Server is the default option. Valid values are: +
  `server`;;
    Creates the properties on the default server instance. This is the default value.
  `domain`;;
    Creates the properties for all server instances in the default domain.
  configuration_name;;
    Creates the properties in the specified configuration.
  cluster_name;;
    Creates the properties on all server instances in the specified cluster.
  instance_name;;
    Creates the properties on a specified server instance.
name=value::
  The name value pairs of the system properties to add to the specified target. Multiple system properties must be separated by a : (colon).
  If a : (colon) appears in the name or value of a system property, it must be escaped with a \ (blackslash). If any system properties were previously defined, they are updated with the new values.
