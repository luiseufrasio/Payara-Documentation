[[description]]
== Description

The `create-managed-scheduled-executor-service` subcommand creates a managed scheduled executor service resource.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

[[options]]
== Options

asadmin-options::
Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these options, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--enabled`::
Determines whether the resource is enabled at runtime.
+
The default value is `true`.
`--contextinfoenabled`::
Determines whether container contexts are propagated to threads. If set to `true`, the contexts specified in the `--contextinfo` option are propagated. If set to `false`, no contexts are propagated and the `--contextinfo` option is ignored.
+
The default value is `true`.
`--contextinfo`::
Specifies individual container contexts to propagate to threads. Valid values are Classloader, JNDI, Security, and WorkArea. Values are specified in a comma-separated list and are case-insensitive.
+
All contexts are propagated by default.
`--threadpriority`::
Specifies the priority to assign to created threads. The default value is 5.
`--longrunningtasks`::
Specifies whether the resource should be used for long-running tasks. The default value is `false`. If set to `true`, long-running tasks are not reported as stuck.
`--hungafterseconds`::
Specifies the number of seconds that a task can execute before it is considered unresponsive. The default value is 0, which means that tasks are never considered unresponsive.
`--corepoolsize`::
Specifies the number of threads to keep in a thread pool, even if they are idle. The default value is 0, which means that a thread is created when the first task is scheduled.
`--keepaliveseconds`::
Specifies the number of seconds that threads can remain idle when the number of threads is greater than `corepoolsize`.
+
The default value is 60.
`--threadlifetimeseconds`::
Specifies the number of seconds that threads can remain in a thread pool before being purged, regardless of whether the number of threads is greater than `corepoolsize` or whether the threads are idle.
+
The default value is 0, which means that threads are never purged.
`--usevirtualthreads`::
If enabled, virtual threads will be used instead of the default platform thread pool. They provide quick creation, minimal overhead, and fast thread switching, but are executed on limited "carrying threads". Use virtual threads for tasks which depend on external resources like databases, micro-services, etc. Do not use them for long calculation.
+
The default value is `false`.
`--description`::
Descriptive details about the resource.
`--property`::
Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource. Payara Server does not define any additional properties for this resource. Moreover, this resource does not currently use any additional properties.
`--target`::
Specifies the target for which you are creating the resource. Valid targets are:
+
`server`;;
Creates the resource for the default server instance. This is the default value.
`domain`;;
Creates the resource for the domain.
cluster_name;;
Creates the resource for every server instance in the specified
cluster.
instance_name;;
Creates the resource for the specified server instance.

[[operands]]
== Operands

jndi_name::
The JNDI name of this resource.
