[[description]]
== Description

The `create-managed-thread-factory` subcommand creates a managed thread factory resource.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

[[options]]
== Options

asadmin-options::
Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these options, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--enabled`::
Determines whether the managed thread factory is enabled at runtime.
+
The default value is `true`.
`--contextinfoenabled`::
Determines whether container contexts are propagated to threads. If set to `true`, the contexts specified in the `--contextinfo` option are propagated. If set to `false`, no contexts are propagated and the `--contextinfo` option is ignored.
+
The default value is `true`.
`--contextinfo`::
Specifies individual container contexts to propagate to threads. Valid values are Classloader, JNDI, Security, and WorkArea. Values are specified in a comma-separated list and are case-insensitive.
+
All contexts are propagated by default.
`--threadpriority`::
Specifies the priority to assign to created threads.
+
The default value is 5.
`--usevirtualthreads`::
If enabled, virtual threads will be used instead of the default platform thread pool. They provide quick creation, minimal overhead, and fast thread switching, but are executed on limited "carrying threads". Use virtual threads for tasks which depend on external resources like databases, micro-services, etc. Do not use them for long calculation.
+
The default value is `false`.
`--description`::
Descriptive details about the resource.
`--property`::
Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring the resource. Payara Server does not define any additional properties for this resource. Moreover, this resource does not currently use any additional properties.
`--target`::
Specifies the target for which you are creating the resource. Valid targets are:
+
`server`;;
Creates the resource for the default server instance. This is the default value.
`domain`;;
Creates the resource for the domain.
cluster_name;;
Creates the resource for every server instance in the specified
cluster.
instance_name;;
Creates the resource for the specified server instance.
