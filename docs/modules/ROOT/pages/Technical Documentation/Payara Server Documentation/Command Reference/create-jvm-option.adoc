== Description

The `create-jvm-options` subcommand creates a single command-line option that is passed to the Java application launcher when Payara Server is started. The options that this subcommand creates are in addition to the options that are preset with Payara Server. Java application launcher options are stored in the Java configuration `java—config` element or the profiler `profiler` element of the `domain.xml` file. The options are sent to the command line in the order they appear in the `java—config` element or the profiler `profiler` element in the `domain.xml` file.

Profiler options are used to record the settings that are required to start a particular profiler. The profiler must already exist. If necessary, use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/create-profiler.adoc#create-profiler[`create-profiler`] subcommand to create the profiler.

This subcommand can be used to create the following types of options:

* Java system properties. These options are set through the `-D` option of the Java application launcher. For example: +
`-Djava.security.manager` +
`-Denvironment=Production`
* Startup parameters for the Java application launcher. These options are preceded by the dash character (`-`). For example: +
`--XX:PermSize=`size +
`-Xmx1024m` +
`-d64`

If the subcommand specifies an option that already exists, the command does not re-create the option.

NOTE: Ensure that any option that you create is valid. The subcommand might allow you to create an invalid option, but such an invalid option can cause startup to fail.

An option can be verified by examining the server log after Payara Server starts. Options for the Java application launcher are written to the `server.log` file before any other information when Payara Server starts.

The addition of some options requires a server restart for changes to become effective. Other options are set immediately in the environment of the domain administration server (DAS) and do not require a restart. Whether a restart is required depends on the type of option.

* Restart is not required for Java system properties whose names do not start with `-Djava.` or `-Djavax.` (including the trailing period). For example, restart is not required for the following Java system property: +
`-Denvironment=Production`
* Restart is required for the following options:

** Java system properties whose names start with `-Djava.` or `-Djavax.` (including the trailing period). For example: +
`-Djava.security.manager`

** Startup parameters for the Java application launcher. For example: +
`-client` +
`-Xmx1024m` +
`-d64`

To restart the DAS, use the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/restart-domain.adoc#restart-domain[`restart-domain`] command.

This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

[[options]]
== Options

asadmin-options::
Options for the `asadmin` utility. For information about these
options, see the xref:Technical Documentation/Payara Server Documentation/Command Reference/asadmin.adoc#asadmin-1m[`asadmin`] help page.
`--help`::
`-?`::
Displays the help text for the subcommand.
`--target`::
Specifies the target on which you are creating Java application launcher options. +
Valid values are as follows: +
`server`;;
Specifies the DAS (default).
instance-name;;
Specifies a Payara Server instance.
cluster-name;;
Specifies a cluster.
configuration-name;;
Specifies a named configuration.
`--profiler`::
Indicates whether the Java application launcher options are for the profiler. The profiler must exist for this option to be true. Default is false.

[[operands]]
== Operands

jvm-option-name::
A single option where the format depends on the following: +
* If the option has a name and a value, the format is option-name=value.
* If the option has only a name, the format is option-name. For example, `-Xmx2048m`.
* If the first option name could be misinterpreted as one or more `asadmin` short options, the format is `--` option-name.
For example, `-server` in the following command could be misinterpreted as `-se`, the `asadmin` short forms for `--secure` and `--echo`:
+
[source,shell]
----
create-jvm-option -server
----
To create the JVM option `-server`, instead use the command:
+
[source,shell]
----
create-jvm-option -- -server
